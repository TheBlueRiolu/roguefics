# Roguefics for All
An engine for creating Roguefics based on baby's first Roguefic.

This engine uses [Necklace of the Eye](http://roguetemple.com/z/noteye/) for its graphics. Games created with RFA can be played without NotEye in a terminal, but NotEye is released under the GPL version 3.

Roguefics should be stored in a common root directory with NotEye. Each one should be stored in a separate directory from the others with at least a `fic.py`, `game.noe`, and `meta.txt`.

If you want to use a framing device to load these games, it is recommended to supply an install script in NotEye format.
