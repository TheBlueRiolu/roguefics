# Roguefics for All
An engine for creating Roguefics based on baby's first Roguefic.

This engine uses [the Python-based version of](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) [Library: The Chronicles of Doryen](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) for its graphics.

Roguefics should be stored in a separate directory from the others with at least a `main.py` and `meta.txt`.
